# vagrant-windows

[Vagrant configuration](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/) for [Microsoft Edge developer virtual machines](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) that bootstraps WinRM access from the host and provisions using [Chef Zero](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/chef_zero.html) to allow painless repeatable setup when the VM expires after 90 days.
